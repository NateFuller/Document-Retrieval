DISCLAIMER: I do not claim all of this work as mine, as some of this work was taken from Professor James
Allen of University of Massachusetts Amherst. Earlier versions, which I will post, do have my original
work, but what is in the master branch DOES use posted solutions from Prof. Allan. You can probably tell
which code is mine and which is not, but I will comment at the top of each file whether it is is Prof.
Allan's work. In no way do I claim his work as my own. I'm merely displaying this project and the its
contents to show knowledge of data structures.
