DISCLAIMER: I do not claim all of this work as mine, as some of this work was taken from 
Professor James Allan of University of Massachusetts Amherst. Earlier versions, which I 
will eventually post, do have my original work, but what is in the master branch uses 
posted solutions from Prof. Allan. You can probably tell which code is mine and which is 
not (due to a lot of my code being "ugly"), but I will comment at the top of each file 
whether it is is Prof. Allan's work. In no way do I claim his work as my own. I'm merely 
displaying this project and the its contents to show my knowledge of data structures.

DESCRIPTION: This was a semester-long project for my Data Structures course at UMass 
Amherst under direction of Prof. James Allan. We learned how to work with Stacks, Queues,
Linked Lists, Maps, Hash Tables, and more that I cannot think of at the moment...
	I am posting this project as a sort of element of my portfolio of my career at UMass.
In the future, I will probably be more tidy with my code since I am going to try to make
this a trend.
